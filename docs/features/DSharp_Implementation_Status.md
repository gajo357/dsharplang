# Compiler implementation status

The original executable baseline is recorded in [bootstrap scope](../COMPILER_BOOTSTRAP.md).
The matrix below includes subsequent implemented feature slices.
This status describes tested implementation, not the full syntax draft.

| Feature | Parse/type-check | Generated execution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| One module, parameterless int literal functions | Implemented and tested | Demo.answer returns 42 |
| Immutable function-local int `let` bindings | Inferred/explicit int, earlier-local initializers and literal/local final expressions tested | Chained bindings return 42; independent functions retain distinct values |
| Typed int parameters and same-module calls | Explicit int parameter/return types, positional argument lists, forward and nested call binding | Generated functions accept int arguments and execute calls |
| UTF-16 string and char literals | Literals, basic escapes, parameters/locals/returns and ordinal equality | Unicode and exact UTF-16 code-unit round trips tested |
| Typed if/else and lexical scopes | Bool conditions, matching int/bool branches and block-local bindings | Both branches and nested conditionals execute lazily |
| Bool values and logic | Bool literals, types, int comparisons, int/bool equality, !, &&, || with type checks | Checked calls, precedence and short-circuit evaluation tested |
| Checked int arithmetic | Unary minus, +, -, *, /, %, precedence and parentheses; int-only operands checked | Precedence/signed division execute; overflow and zero division fault at invocation |
| Whitespace and single-line comments | Implemented and tested | Included in source pipeline |
| Source diagnostics and duplicate functions | Implemented and tested | Rejected before emission |
| CLI check/compile | Implemented, smoke-tested | SDK builds generated library |
| Remaining language syntax | Unsupported, explicit diagnostics | Not implemented |
| Workers/queues/runtime/interop/LSP | Not implemented | Not claimed |

Preserve syntax reference revision 0.3 selected behaviour, while freezing each
provisional contract before implementing it. Worker-call failure representation,
queue lifecycle, durable serialization, middleware, authorization capability
validity, numeric extensions and safe .NET interop remain decisions for later
small milestones. No agent isolation or durability follows from this bootstrap.

## Planned work

Follow the [Codex web implementation sequence](implementation/DSharp_Implementation_Sequence.md)
and [task queue](implementation/DSharp_Task_Queue.md). [Issue #7](https://github.com/gajo357/dsharplang/issues/7)
is implemented: one binding per line, optional `: int`, no reassignment or shadowing.
[Issue #19](https://github.com/gajo357/dsharplang/issues/19) extends initializers and
final expressions with checked int arithmetic and parentheses. Numeric tokens
remain nonnegative literals in 0..2147483647; unary minus is an operator, and
`-2147483648` is still rejected. Binary operators are left-associative with
multiplicative precedence. Operands evaluate left to right. Division truncates
toward zero; remainder follows the dividend sign. Overflow (including the CLR
minimum-int divided/remainder by -1 cases) and division/remainder by zero are
execution faults, even for constant-looking expressions. No arithmetic is folded
at binding time. Binding declarations retain their one-line boundary.
Bindings become visible after their initializer and never cross function boundaries.
Reassignment (DS2005), duplicate locals (DS2006), unknown/self/forward/cross-function
references (DS2007), unsupported local annotations (DS2008) and out-of-range int literals
(DS2004) are rejected with D# source spans. Malformed declarations and unsupported
expressions continue to produce source diagnostics.

See [the example](../../examples/let-bindings.ds) and
[implementation plan and evidence](implementation/issue-7-plan.md).
Also see [the arithmetic example](../../examples/int-arithmetic.ds) and
[arithmetic plan/evidence](implementation/issue-19-plan.md).
[Issue #20](https://github.com/gajo357/dsharplang/issues/20) adds explicit int
parameters and positional calls in the same module, resolved regardless of
declaration order. Parameter names cannot be duplicated, reassigned or redeclared
as locals; unknown functions, wrong arity and unsupported types are rejected.
Calls and arguments evaluate in source order. See [the example](../../examples/function-calls.ds)
and [plan](implementation/issue-20-plan.md).
[Issue #21](https://github.com/gajo357/dsharplang/issues/21) adds `bool` values
and annotations in functions, parameters and locals, int comparisons, int/bool
equality, and `!`, `&&`, `||` with short-circuit evaluation. Operands and call/
return types must match; unparenthesized chained comparisons are rejected. There
is no truthiness. See [the example](../../examples/bool-logic.ds) and
[implementation plan](implementation/issue-21-plan.md).
[Issue #22](https://github.com/gajo357/dsharplang/issues/22) adds value-producing
`if`/`else` expressions with bool conditions, matching branch types, and nested
block-local bindings. Branch names do not escape; redeclaring a visible local
or parameter is rejected, while sibling branches may reuse a name. Only the
selected branch executes. Else is required because Unit is not yet implemented.
See [the example](../../examples/if-scopes.ds) and
[implementation plan](implementation/issue-22-plan.md).
[Issue #23](https://github.com/gajo357/dsharplang/issues/23) adds immutable
UTF-16 `string` and `char` values, quoted literals and basic escapes. A `char`
is exactly one UTF-16 code unit; malformed literals and unsupported escapes are
rejected. String equality is ordinal. See [the example](../../examples/text-literals.ds)
and [implementation plan](implementation/issue-23-plan.md). Interpolation,
raw/multiline strings and concatenation remain unsupported.
Additional primitives and runtime features remain unsupported.
Instruction reconciliation in #8 does not add language behavior. Issue creation,
approval labels and planning PRs are not implementation evidence; update the matrix
only when the behavior and relevant generated execution/rejection tests pass.
